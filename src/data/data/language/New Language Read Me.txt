We are always looking for people to translate Desura into as many Languages as possible.

If you want to translate please follow these steps:
 - Copy english.xml and english_utility.xml renaming them to the target language (i.e. [language].xml [language]_utility.xml)
 - Use a text editor like notepad++ (or one that supports utf8)
 - Translate the strings in the file
 - Update the author to include your moddb/desura username and profile url (this is not used atm but might be later)
 - Update the language name (the name attribute as part of the lang node)
 - Make sure the utf8 header is included "<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>" (with out the quotes) on the first line
 - Make sure you save the file as utf8

Once done email dev@desura.com and it will be included in the next build.
