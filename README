Desura
===================

Desura is a gaming client that allows users to one click download and install games and game modification.

Build Desura Windows
===================

To build Desura you will need Visual Studio 2008 and also Visual Studio 2010

Download and install:
 * TortoiseSvn http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html. Make sure to install command line tools
 * TortoiseGit http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/downloads/list
 * Windows Sdk 7.1 http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8279
 * Python 2.7 http://www.python.org/getit/
 * SCons http://www.scons.org/download.php

Check Out git repo
Launch visual studio 2010 command prompt and cd into the desura/src/third_party
Run SVNCheckOut.bat
Run BuildAll.bat
Copy branding_default in desura/src to desura/src/branding


This should now allow you to open the desura solution in desura/build_win/desura.sln and build the desura client but you still need to build Cef

Once built, open console to the desura/build_out and run "copy_data.bat [dest]" with dest being debug_win or release_win


Build Cef Windows
===================

This requires visual studio 2008. You can cheat and copy the cef dll's from a current Desura install instead of this step.

Have a look at desura/src/third_party/cef/CHROMIUM_BUILD_COMPATIBILITY.txt and note the last svn repo (at time of writing its 91424)

Create a dir called chromium in the desura/src/third_party folder
Launch command prompt and cd into the desura/src/third_party/chromium
Run these commands (where SVN VERSION is the number found above):
 set PATH=%PATH%:../depot_tools
 gclient config http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src
 gclient sync --revision src@[SVN VERSION]

Once complete copy desura/src/third_party/cef to desura/src/third_party/chromium/src/cef
Run cef_create_projects.bat in desura/src/third_party/chromium/src/cef
And then you should be able to build cef using visual studio 2008 solution file.
You will need to copy the output dll's into the desura/build_out/[mode]_win/bin folder (where mode is debug or release)


Run Desura Windows
===================

You will need to run the debug build as the release build will try and auto update itself upon start. You can do this by running desura-d.exe
from the folder or setup visual studio to use the desura-d.exe from the build_out/debug_win and also use this as the current working dir


Build Desura Linux
===================

Following commands must be invoked in the root of source tree.

The script "install-deps.sh" will install building dependecies on major Linux distros. For now it supports Arch, Debian and it's derivatives like Ubuntu and Mint, Red Hat and it's derivatives like Fedora.
If your distro is not supported yet, read this script and install corresponding packages for it. In case of succes, please send us a patch.
To run the script, enter the following line in a command line and press enter.

./install-deps.sh

We don't want to use Desura branding, so invoke:
cp -r src/branding_default src/branding

Then run the build script
./build_cmake.sh


Build Cef Linux
===================

You can cheat and copy the cef so's from a current Desura install instead of this step.
To do that copy libcef_desura.so from current Desura's lib/ directory
to Desura's build_out/debug_lin/lib/. It's possible that it will be missing some dependencies.
Easy way to check if this is the case is to invoke:

ldd build_out/debug_lin/lib/libcef_desura.so | grep "not found"

Check output against Desura's build_out/debug_lin/lib/ and build_out/debug_lin/lib_extra/ content. If some stuff is missing
you should be able to find it in in "old" client's lib/ and lib_extra/ directories (also copy it to
corresponding directories).


Have a look at desura/src/third_party/cef/CHROMIUM_BUILD_COMPATIBILITY.txt and note the last svn repo (at time of writing its 91424). Make sure you replace [CEF SVN VERSION]


#!/bin/bash
# Run from root repo dir
# Checkout Chromium
source env.sh
cd src/third_party/
# Make sure you apply the patches in src/third_party/patches/ first.
mkdir chromium
cd chromium
gclient config http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src
gclient sync --revision src@[CEF SVN VERSION] #from above
mv ../cef src/
cd ..
ln -s chromium/src/cef .
cd build_lin
./BuildCef.sh


Build Courgette Linux
===================

Only do this after you have the Chromium repo checked out.

#!/bin/bash
# Run from root repo dir
source env.sh
cd src/third_party/
# Make sure you apply the patches in src/third_party/patches/ first.
cp -r courgette/* chromium/src/courgette
cd build_lin
./BuildCourgette.sh


Run Desura Linux
===================

If you built the debug build (default) you should be able to run ./test.sh in the build_lin folder to test or ./desura in the build_out/debug_lin folder
