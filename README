Build Desura on Linux
===================

Run ./build_desura.sh

In order to make use of multiple CPU cores while compiling, run
./build_desura.sh -j8
which will invoke "make -j8" so the build is speeded up extremely
and takes only 7 mins on a modern machine (intel core i7 2635QM)
"8" will be the number of compile-thread to run at a time.

You can find out the number of cores you have running:
getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN

Required dependencies (can be installed by package manager or install-deps.sh):
boost
c-ares (for ares support in curl)
cmake
gtk2
OpenSSL
tinyxml
v8

Optional dependencies (will be built by cmake if not existing):
bzip2
curl (while building without ares support)
sqlite

cef is needed from official distribution see #5 and #107
Just copy required libs to install/lib

Finally run Desura using ./run_desura.sh

Build Desura on Windows
=====================

Download and install:
 * TortoiseSvn http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html. Make sure to install command line tools
 * msysGit https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list
 * TortoiseSvn: http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html
 * TortoiseGit http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/downloads/list. Make sure to install at least the patch tool
 * Windows Sdk 7.1 http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8279
  (If applicable)
 * Python 2.7 http://www.python.org/getit/
 * SCons http://www.scons.org/download.php (same architecture as python 2.7!)
 * CMake 2.8 http://www.cmake.org/

 Note: Make sure you add git to your environment path and also set SVN_PATH to point to the tortise svn path

Open a 32bit cmd.exe with env vars set up by vc or other scripts (so we have a full build environment)
run ./build_desura.bat
wait

Getting Cef Libraries on Linux
=====================

Run getceflibs.sh after building Desura. Make sure you don't disable building the tools.
