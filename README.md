Note: Make sure you add svn and python to your environment PATH

Open a 32bit cmd.exe with env vars set up by vc or other scripts (so we have a full build environment) and run:

    ./build_desura.bat

wait

Special notes for advanced users
=====================

Desura is using the cmake build system for configuration on prject files for several build systems (make, VS, nmake, ...).
At the top of CMakeFile.txt is a documented list of options

a "normal" way to configure cmake would be something like this:

  * UNIX-based systems:
    1. mkdir build
    2. cd build
    3. cmake ..
    4. make
    5. sudo make install (optionally)

  * win32 based systems:
    1. md build
    2. cd build
    3. cmake ..
    4. open project files and compile them
