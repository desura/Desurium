or you can build DEB package:

    ./build_desura.sh pack_deb

or you can build RPM package:

    ./build_desura.sh pack_rpm

Finally run Desurium using:

    ./install/desura

or install created DEB or RPM package

For informations on advanced arguments of the build script, run:

    ./build_desura.sh help

Build Desura on Windows
=====================

Download and install:

 * TortoiseSvn http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html. Make sure to install command line tools
 * msysGit https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list
 * Windows Sdk 7.1 http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8279
  (If applicable)
 * Python 2.7 http://www.python.org/getit/
 * SCons http://www.scons.org/download.php (same architecture as python 2.7!)
 * CMake 2.8 http://www.cmake.org/

Note: Make sure you add git to your environment path and also set SVN_PATH to point to the tortoise svn path

Open a 32bit cmd.exe with env vars set up by vc or other scripts (so we have a full build environment) and run:

    ./build_desura.bat

wait

Special notes for advanced users
=====================

Desura is using the cmake build system for configuration on prject files for several build systems (make, VS, nmake, ...).
At the top of CMakeFile.txt is a documented list of options

a "normal" way to configure cmake would be something like this:

  * UNIX-based systems:
    1. mkdir build
    2. cd build
    3. cmake ..
    4. make
    5. sudo make install (optionally)

  * win32 based systems:
    1. md build
    2. cd build
    3. cmake ..
    4. open project files and compile them
